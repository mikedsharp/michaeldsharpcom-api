# michaeldsharpcom-api
The back-end app for michaeldsharp.com

## What will I be used for? 

First and foremost, to deliver content to my portfolio site michaeldsharp.com, the API will deliver projects by ID, list 
project JSON that can be consumed by the michaeldsharp.com front-end

## future plans
In the near to mid-term, I intend to create some locked down CRUD endpoints to allow for an Admin page, where I can add new projects and edit existings ones. I will need to implement a some form of Auth to protect the POST/PUT/DELETE operations.
