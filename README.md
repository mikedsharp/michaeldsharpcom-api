# michaeldsharpcom-api
The back-end app for michaeldsharp.com

## What will I be used for? 

First and foremost, to deliver content to my portfolio site michaeldsharp.com, the API will deliver projects by ID, list 
project JSON that can be consumed by the michaeldsharp.com front-end

## Future plans
In the near to mid-term, I intend to create some locked down CRUD endpoints to allow for an Admin page, where I can add new projects and edit existings ones. I will need to implement a some form of Auth to protect the POST/PUT/DELETE operations. 

## Heady ambitions
If I have any ideas for projects that require some form of API resource, I would like to put it into this application, if the project is successful and requires scaling, I will migrate the endpoints to their own independent APIs, but this app will act as a form of "proving ground" for projects i'm working on. 

In addition, I presume that michaeldsharp.com will grow into something bigger, and it may be desirable to add additional endpoints to facilitate some actions that require a back-end, as and when the features are implemented (think commenting systems, email forms etc)
